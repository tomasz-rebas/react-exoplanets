## react-exoplanets

This web app allows you to browse through the database entries about discovered exoplanets (planets from outside the Solar System). It features pagination and dynamic data filtering - use checkboxes and sliders from the sidebar to filter the planets based on their discovery year, density, mass etc.

The app fetches the data from [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/).

The app is written in ReactJS with TypeScript and uses Material-UI library for styling and various predefined components. The state is managed by Hooks.

This project was initially bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and then migrated to [Vite](https://vite.dev/).
